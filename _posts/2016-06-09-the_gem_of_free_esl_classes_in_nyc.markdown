Two years ago, I moved to New York and it was the first time for me to live in the other country. Same as a typical Japanese, I was not good at English especially speaking and listening. I needed to find an English class and non-Japanese friends. 

I searched a lot because I wanted to go to a reasonable class. I found a lot of free English classes in NY since there are many immigrants as me. In the future, I want to create a website for the new people in New York. So, I created the gem of free ESL Classes in NYC.

Whan I created my first gem, I was impressed two points.

First, I created my first gem with bundler by watching Avi's helpful video and searching Google. I was impressed that it was a very simple way to create a new gem. Some people create Hello_world gem, it seemed very easy to create, however, I faced some bugs in my learn IDE, I stuck with it. But now, I will do it faster.

Next, I stuck with scraping. At first, I coded along with Avi's video, so it was a success. But I tried to do it by myself, I stuck with an error of NoNameError. The end of my coding, I wanted to add ".summary" for my Esl::Lesson class. I learned that I had to load URL data in the console and I could scrape something. I learned former lessons for scraping, but I didn't understand deeply. I was impressed how to use a console to edit my gem. This coding was so hard for me to complete, but finally, I did it.
