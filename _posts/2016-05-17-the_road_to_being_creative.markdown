Looking back on my life, I always search for creativity.

I majored in sociology at Keio University in Japan. After my graduated, I worked at a seasoning company as a sales and marketing representative. I wanted to make new products, but I realized
that all I could do was to make plans for new products. Because of my major field, I needed help by people who have technical skills to create new products. 

After that year, I enjoyed my occupation, though, I decided to change my career. I wanted to do more creative or create something. I worked at a publishing company for business books, made plans, edited sentences, and searched authors and designers. I was very happy because I could create new products and play a major role to do that. 

About a year later, I moved to New York because of my husband's work. I became a freelance editor for business books in Japanese. I came to write a blog for my friends about NY life, events, culture and so on. I used a default format to write posts since it was very easy to make the blog, however, I got to be uncomfortable the stable format. Yes, I wanted to do more creative.

At first, I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 through taking online courses in Japanese. Although I was a beginner, I enjoyed the new creative world. At that point, I realized there was a lot more to a website than just HTML and CSS, so I wanted to learn more complicated and fundamental things. Programming.

In the near future, I want to work at American company but, as I'm not a native speaker, it's difficult for me to get a job as an editor in English. If I learn cording, I can get a job as a programmer. So I decided to learn cording more deeply.

Now, I learn cording through flatiron school online course. It's not the easy way to learn cording, but I feel I come to be more creative.
