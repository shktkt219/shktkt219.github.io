When I took my first technical interview, I confused to explain the Object-oriented  programming (OOP). So I would like to write a post about OOP.

OOP is a programming language model organized around objects and data rather than action and logic. Ruby is one of the OOP languages and the others are Java, Python, C++, etc.

OOP programming provides these important benefits: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

# Encapsulation
Wrapping up a data member and a method together into a single unit (in other words class) is called Encapsulation. Encapsulation is like enclosing in a capsule. That is enclosing the related operations and data related to an object into that object. Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of an object, in other words how an object does something. Encapsulation prevents clients from seeing its inside view, where the behavior of the abstraction is implemented.  

# Inheritance
The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Called inheritance, this property of OOP forces a more through data analysis, reduces development time, and ensures more accurate coding.

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one name, many forms. One function behaves in different forms.

ex. A man behaves a business person in an office at the same time that man behaves the husband in a house.
