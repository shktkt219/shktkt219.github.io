Last Thursday, I attended a meetup about Go at Nulab. Nulab's main programming language is Java, but they try to shift it to Go. It was the first time for the company to held a meetup about Golang, so we learned the way of installing and "Hello World".

# About Go
Go, also known as Golang, is a computer programming language whose development began in 2007 at Google. Go is open source, has good performance and continues to grow in popularity. Go is a System Language. Similar to C++ and Java, Go is a compiled language, however, a compilation is much easier than the other languages. The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness.

# Install
If you have a mac PC, all you have to do is to input `brew install go`. Or, you can install [here](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.8.darwin-amd64.pkg). When you input `go version` in terminal, you can see your installed go version.

# Hello World
We try to execute "Hello World". You can write codes like this at your text editor:

Then, input `go run hello.go` in your terminal.

You can see "Hello World" in the terminal! That's the reason that Go's compilation is much easier than the other compiled languages.

Do you want to build "hello"? You can build it the only typing `go build hello.go`.

You can play Golang at [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).
# Conclusion
I don't know so much about syntaxes of Golang, but I'm interested in learning new programming languages and enjoyed the experiences of Golang. Stay tuned.
