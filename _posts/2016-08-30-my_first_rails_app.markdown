Finally, I've finished making my first rails app. I created mini post app, it's similar to Twitter because I heard Twitter used to use rails. This rails app project was hard for me and I got stuck.

# sticking point
At first, I tried to make my own authentication logic. It was good for me to review, but when I tried to make my authentication system to allow login from Facebook, I got stuck.

I googled a lot, but I could find only about devise with omniauth-facebook. I tried to change my code, but I didn't. After few days, I changed my mind and used devise for my app.  

Devise is the very complicated gem but it's very useful for authentication logic. It took three days for creating my own authentication codes, on the other hand, when I used devise, it took only thirty minutes. My sticking point, omniauth-facebook, was finally resolved. But I had to erase my codes for my own authentication logic. It was tough for me but good to review and understand more deeply about devise gem and authentication.

I sometimes checked real Twitter app. It's sophisticated design and has a lot of functions. In addition, the app has the elegant user interface. I want to make this kind of app in the near future.
