For my technical interviews, I started to use a site of Interview Cake because I knew that site on the slack conversations. I tried to the first question, it was a greedy pattern. Umm. How should I know the patterns for technical interviews?

According to Parker who works for Interview Cake, we should need to know the patterns of the questions.

1.  Brute Force
2. Greedy
3. Use a Hash Table

I should know a lot more, but it's very good suggestion for me because I stuck with the technical interview's questions. There are a lot of hints in that site, Interview Cake, and Paker said "Use them all. Don't be shy." I relieved that comment.

I tried to solve the first question "Apple stocks", it was useful. Some hints inspired me of some codes, however, it's not easy for me, but I learned a lot. I didn't know a greedy approach, so when I solve the questions, I will try to consider what kind of approach this question need. 

In Interview Cake, we can also choose languages. At first, I tried to solve ruby questions, but next, I will try to Javascript questions.
