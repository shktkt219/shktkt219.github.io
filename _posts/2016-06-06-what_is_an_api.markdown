I read news about Uber's APIs recently. I have read this kind of news that a company starts to provide their APIs. It seems that a lot of companies open their APIs. But what is an API?






### APIs: Entrances to the code.

API stands for application programming interface. An API is essentially a way for programmers to communicate with a certain application. On your desktop, an API is what lets some applications talk to others or access features of the operating system. 

I think of APIs as entrances because they let data in and out of a Web service. But they can only perform in a certain way. In addition, they are typically open for only the people who have keys to the entrance because they have rules. This API's limitation makes it possible for applications to share data and take actions without requiring developers to share all of their software's code.

### Example of an API : Google Maps APIs

At Google, they provide some APIs: Google Web APIs, Google Maps APIs and so on. Let's look in detail about Google Maps API. If you want to access Google Maps APIs, you can check [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/?csw=1).


Google Maps APIs are available for Android iOS, web browsers and via HTTP web services. Millions of apps and sites are using Google Maps APIs, such as WhatsApp, Airbnb, Citi bike and so on. You can see showcase [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/showcase/).


When you create an application a kind of "Restroom Finder in NYC", you can use Google Maps APIs to develop the application. If you don't use this kind of maps APIs, you will have to build not only the app but also the map. It's very complicated and a waste of time. APIs can encourage programmers to more  creative applications.
